### Verantwortlichkeiten

- **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring, preventing , detecting , investigating, and responding to threats within a company’s network and systems.

-  **Incident Responder** is responsible for investigating and responding to ongoing security incidents within the organisation.
They will monitor and prevent attackers in real time and share lessons learned during the attack to prevent future incidents.

-  **Security Engineer** develops and maintains the essential tools and systems that support the defensive security team.
These systems enable the team to monitor, investigate, and explore events within an organisation.

- **Digital Forensics** will utilise their expertise to understand what occurred during an incident.
They will gather, preserve, and analyse evidence from the network and systems to uncover vital information about the attackers and their methods.

#### Key areas of defensive security:

 
| Monitoring and Detecting | Incident Response | Threat Intelligence | Vulnerability Management | Investigation and Analysis |
|--------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Continually observing network and system activity to detect suspicious behaviour and events. These may include, for example, monitoring for logins from another country while the employee is based in the company's London office.  | The team quickly comes together if suspicious activity is confirmed and alerts are raised. This is when the Incident Response process begins. The process involves containing and removing the threat and restoring the business back to normality. | Gathering and using information about attackers—their latest methods, targets, and trends—can greatly strengthen an organisation’s defences. For example, understanding that an attacker focuses on a specific software application used within organisations. | Fixing software or system flaws is an important preventative measure that can lower the risk of an attack. Security teams can check which systems attackers are most likely to target. This can be done manually or with the help of automated tools. | Members of a defensive security team are always monitoring and analysing what’s happening inside an organisation. They work to separate normal activity from suspicious behaviour, digging into the details like solving a puzzle to uncover valuable insights. |
